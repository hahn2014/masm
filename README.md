Microsoft Assembly Projects

1.  Project 1
  -  Develop a program that takes in 2 user inputs and calculates 4 different math functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and returns their values.
2.  Project 2
  -  Develop a program to print out the Fibonacci sequence with a user inputed number of prints. Change the color of the background screen and text color
3.  Project 3
  -  Develop a program that takes in negative numbers between -100 and -1 until a positive number is inputted. Then calculate the sum of the negative numbers, how many negatives were inputted, and the average of the numbers.
4.  Project 4
  -  Develop a program that takes in an integer between a specified range, then print how the provided n number of composite number terms (between range of 1 and 400)
5.  Project 5
  -  Develop a program that asks the user how many random numbers in the range of 100 to 999 will be generated. Store the numbers into an array then print. Sort the array from largest to smallest, print the mean number, and then finally print the array in sorted order.
6.  Project 6
  -  Develop a program that will generate a random problem in format (n!)/(r!(n-r)!) and ask the user to answer. It will continue to generate problems until the user asks to stop.
